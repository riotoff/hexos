there are hex operating systems with different bit depths.

there are:
hexOS-16 - Mostly just test model
hexOS-32 - Good but legacy model
hexOS-64 - Active and best model

we made hex project to show people real netwide assembly;
but basically hexos created for the simplest method of working in the field of IT sciences.
